# Solidity Comment Function Labelling
This repo provides a Web UI for quickly labeling solididy functions using the Gradio interface

    - First press the `Start` button to get started.
    - Analyze both the comment and the associated code
    - Correct either the comment or the code to be aligned. Also correct both is necessary
    - If possible reduce the comment to be shorter and precise
    - Press `Submit` to submit a valid label pair
    - Press `Flag` to flag the comment-code pair if those do the fit at all
    - A new comment-code pair will be displyed to be labeled

    P.S. Each piece of code originates from a contract file, therefore some variable might be declared outside the function scope
